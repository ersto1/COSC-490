# CODE SHOULD BE RUN ON - colab.research.google.com

Download and upload the csv file in Google Colaboratory before running the 'Baltimore1Building1Data.ipynb' code.

The code we first started off with showing our dataset with all of the features. 
Then we dropped the features we feel we didn't need, that repeated in other columns, or that wouldn't be able to show points on for example, the boxplot
Then the next few is data on the AREA feature which is the target feature we wanted to focus on in the prediction part. 
Then we show a scatter plot of all the features 
Then we show a box plot of our features and we mainly wanted to try and point out any ouliers, like you see in AREA.
Then everything after that is basically steps of machine learning that he wanted us to follow to get to our end result
The end result being that he wanted us to do machine learning on our code to accurately predict a value within our target feature from other information.
